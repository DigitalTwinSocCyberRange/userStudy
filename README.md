This repository is part of the [DigitalTwinSocCyberrange](https://github.com/DigitalTwinSocCyberrange) project. It contains all anonymized data collected during a user study for evaluating the DigitalTwinSocCyberrange. 

The files and directories contain the following data:

- **questionnaires:** The questionnaires, which were used for the assessment of the knowledge and the feedback.
- **results.csv & results.xlsx:** All data collected during the user study in a prepared form. These are, on the one hand, the data collected during the pre- and post-test. The value 1 represents a correct answer and the value 0 represents an incorrect answer. On the other hand, the data that were automatically collected by the cyber range during the execution (such as the achieved score and the times) are included.
- **results_SPSS.sav:** The data, from the pre- or post-test, in a format prepared for SPSS, in order to facilitate statistical analysis.
- **trainee_data_raw.csv:** The raw data, automatically collected by the cyber range, in unprocessed format.
